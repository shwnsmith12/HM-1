# Code Refactor Starter Code

This repository is a mockup page for a company called Horiseon Social Solution Services. You'll find information on services the company provides such as:

Horiseon also provides assistance with:

Cost Management

What specifically was done on this project was refactoring specific parts of the code to streamline it by changing certain sections to semantically correct HTML elements, as well as consolodating some of the CSS code that was redundant. There were also a few links that were broken, that should be useable at this time.
